Energy consumption is a major source of global CO? emissions, with the energy sector accounting for about 73% of global CO? emissions in 2021.
Coal-fired power plants emit about 820 grams of CO? per kWh of electricity generated.
Natural gas power plants emit about 450 grams of CO? per kWh of electricity generated.
Wind and Solar have near-zero CO? emissions during operation, though the production of equipment does have some emissions.
