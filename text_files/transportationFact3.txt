Factors Influencing CO2 Emissions
- Variations in emissions are influenced by a mixture of factors:
1. High truck activity and low fuel efficiency contributed significantly to higher emissions.
2. Urban development patterns, such as population density and job distribution, affect fuel efficiency and emissions.
3. Wealthier metropolitan areas generally exhibited higher emissions per capita
