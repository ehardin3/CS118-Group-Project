To help reduce your carbon footprint, you can do the following:
1. Take the bus every so often. If you took your car to school and you live 5 miles away then the emission for there and back would be 3 kg. 
  If you took the bus then the emission for there and back would be 1 kg.
2. Turn the lights off when you're not using them. For one hour of Incandescent bulbs being on, the emission is 0.05 kg.
3. Make your own food. Bringing your food in your own container is 83 times better than a 
  prepackaged meal (taking into account the emissions from food production, packaging, and delivery.)
