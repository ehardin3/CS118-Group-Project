WARNING!
This program does not take into account many factors that actual people take into account when making decisions.
Some of these questions mention cost but people's finances are NOT included in the calculations.
Some of these questions also assume certain things so that the calculations are easier to figure out.
Most of the facts are from sources from the last few years, however, many of the calculations are taken from sources that are a little older since the newer sources don't have actual equations.
We are only asking a couple of questions, so this will only be a rough estimate. If we wanted to get an actual estimate of your carbon emission there would be way too many questions, 
including if you want to take this little quiz.
