Explanation of Emission Factors
Our team researched transportation emissions from reputable sources to determine realistic values for this project. These factors represent average emissions based on common assumptions and publicly available data.
	1.	Bus Emission Factor (ef_bus = 0.1 kg CO₂ per mile)
Buses are more efficient because they carry many passengers. Research shows emissions range from 0.05 to 0.15 kg CO₂ per mile, depending on the fuel type and passenger load. We selected 0.1 as a reasonable average for a diesel-powered bus with moderate occupancy.
	2.	Car Emission Factor (ef_car = 0.3 kg CO₂ per mile)
Cars emit more CO₂ than buses, with emissions ranging between 0.25 and 0.35 kg CO₂ per mile based on fuel efficiency. For example, larger vehicles like SUVs emit more, while compact cars emit less. We used 0.3 to represent a mid-sized car with average efficiency.
	3.	Carpool Emission Factor (ef_carpool = 0.3 kg CO₂ per mile, divided by passengers)
Carpooling divides emissions among passengers, so we used the same factor as a car (0.3) but divided it by the number of passengers to reflect shared responsibility. This approach is common in carbon calculators.
	4.	Non-Motorized Modes (zero value = 0.0)
Walking and biking don’t produce direct CO₂ emissions, so we assigned them 0.0 kg CO₂ per mile.
Sources We Consulted
	•	EPA Data: Emissions from passenger vehicles and public transit.
	•	Carbon Calculators: Online tools like the CoolClimate Network.
	•	Transportation Studies: General research on emissions by mode.
Summary
These factors are averages based on credible sources. While real-world values vary (e.g., electric vehicles or bus occupancy), our estimates provide a practical starting point for understanding transportation-related emissions.
